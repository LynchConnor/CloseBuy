## What I learned
- This was my first <b>big</b> project using SwiftUI, so I learned a lot of SwiftUI.
- I increased my understanding of database management and models, as well as the use of third party frameworks like Firebase.
- Reusability of code to better the user experience.
- Asynchronous data fetching with completion blocks and error handling with try, catch blocks.
